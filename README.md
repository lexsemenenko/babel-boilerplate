## Babel Boilerplate

I created this boilerplate to test Babel features for my bigger projects.  It's a minimal setup by design which makes it easier to see what's happening and more comfortable to debug. 

- No Webpack for simplicity


## Usage

Run Live-Server
```
$ npm run server
```

Run Build
```
$ npm run build
```
